# Credit Card Launch Analysis

## Overview
Mitron Bank is seeking to introduce a new line of credit cards to broaden its product offerings and market reach. AtliQ Data Services proposed to implement this project, and to demonstrate their capabilities, Mitron Bank requested a pilot project with sample data before proceeding further. Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services, has been tasked with analyzing the provided sample data and presenting key findings to Mitron Bank's strategy team. The success of the project hinges on Peter's ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations that impress Mitron Bank's management.

## Objective
Design a dashboard to analyze the provided sample data and provide insights to guide the development of the new credit cards. The dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand for Mitron Bank's top-level management and product strategy team.

## Metrics and Analysis
1. **Demographic Classification**: Classified customers based on demographics such as age group, gender, occupation, etc., and provide insights based on them.
2. **Avg Income Utilisation %**: Calculated the average income utilization percentage of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). Higher utilization suggests a higher likelihood of credit card usage.
3. **Spending Insights**: Identified the top spending categories and analyze spending patterns based on demographics (occupation, gender, city, age, etc.).
4. **Key Customer Segments**: Profile key customer segmented based on demographics, spending behaviors, and financial preferences.

## Dashboard Design
The dashboard includes interactive visualizations and summary statistics presenting the following:
- Demographic breakdown of customers
- Average income utilization percentage
- Spending distribution across different categories
- Comparison of spending patterns by occupation, gender, city, and age group
- Identification of key customer segments
- Recommendations for credit card features based on insights

## Conclusion
By analyzing the sample data and presenting actionable insights through the dashboard, the project aims to guide Mitron Bank in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends, ultimately enhancing the likelihood of successful acquisition and adoption in the financial market.
